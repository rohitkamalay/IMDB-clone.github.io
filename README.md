# IMDB Clone

## IMDB-clone.github.io

## Built purly on Vanilla Javascript and Tailwind CSS

#### This project provided me with a basic understanding of how APIs work and how to utilize the fetch() function. I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project because it allowed me to interact with elements using JavaScript instead of relying on Node.js or MongoDB. As a result, I gained a better understanding of the DOM node structure and became more adept at writing clean and organized code. This project served as a valuable lesson, as it emphasized the importance of writing code in a neat manner; otherwise, it becomes challenging to debug. Initially, I encountered several issues and had to rebuild the project from scratch three times due to my code becoming disorganized and difficult to troubleshoot. However, I persevered, and now I have a fully functional movie database application. You can currently use it to search for movies and add them to your favorites list. I plan to add more features in the near future.
